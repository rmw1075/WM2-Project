        <h1>Syntax</h1>
            <h2>Indentation</h2>
                <p>
                    In Python, code indentation is extremely important. Unlike other languages where the spaces do not matter, Python will return errors if indentation is ignored. Indentation at the start of a line indicates that the code on that line belongs in a block with the code above it. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this case, the indented print statement is used to show that this statement is connected to the [changed based on whats in screenshot] statement above it. 
                </p>
        
        
            <h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
                <p>
                    Many programming languages have specific rules for how to declare a new variable. In Python, however, a variable is declared simply by setting a variable name or character equal to something else. You do not have to declare the variable’s type, or use a certain command to do so.
                </p>

            <h2>Comments</h2>
                <p>
                    Comments are an important part of coding, as they tell other programmers what your code does, or can remind you if you return to a program after not looking at it for a while. Different programs have different syntax for comments, but in Python, a comment begins with a #, and includes the entire line. This means that every line that you want to be commented out must begin with a #.
                </p>
                <!--screenshot (#Start a comment with a hashtag or something like that)-->

            <h2>Import Statements</h2>
                <p>
                    In Python, files can be linked to each other and called within another file. A .py (Python) file is known as a <i>module</i>. Modules can be imported into other Python files by using the <i>import</i> statement. The syntax for this is <i>import filename</i>. The import statement MUST go at the top of a Python file.
